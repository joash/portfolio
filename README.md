**I am the one!**

Baptized the 'Madaraka Express', the smoking train finally snaked its way through a late sunrise into Nairobi. The Express was rusty and clumsy. A bunch of lazy hyenas scattered into thickets thick with dew. They laughed at the Express. These saliva drenched beasts wouldn't stand the smell of dreamers on board. Three days of misery perched like a bat against a window on this iron horse out of my village, and four years later studying the art of story telling with a bunch of witty Professors, I knew that my fate was boldy sealed. I would be sitting patiently like an old buffalo chewing cud, while some silly female mosquitoes tried to bite my ass. Accidentally, as my village manners were being replaced by city jeans, I won myself the best-student award by hungrily squeezing avocado juice out of Statistics and Computer Science books. Like a mouse trap, I caught those top-grades in hiralious ambushes; late night book-worming and some cheese in my dreams!   

Meanwhile, as i was being punched with an education, and fried in the science of numbers, the good Lord made some beautiful rocks. To humor me, he buried them deep in dirt and allowed mountain gorillas to be sentinels. Look at me now...Lord, I mine these very rocks for something called data; a tasty spice that serious people use today to brew stories mixed with coffee and success. As for the myth of gorillas, I have never seen 'em. Maybe I am the data gorilla...GRRRRRRR!  

At sunset, my mother thinks I am a __data specialist__, an agile software developer or a __visual storyteller__. I go by many names depending on which data mountain I am invading. For the last 10+ years, I have chopped up interesting data over innovative design boards, modelled crazy parts in furnices lit by some bad-ass witchy algorithms, and built solid evidence-based data workflows in a rogue language called R, and Python. Speaking of Python - which is not a hissing creature - when my heavenly star - Cancer, the crab - is out, and running through the seaside, I teach my data models stuff about predictive thinking in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Most times however, I ride a verocious white cancer-branded crab called Sahmiye with a Twitter handle @inNz10 hanging over my ass on the Internet. It's fun; I sniff, scout, discover and visualize critical insights, hidden patterns, and valuable [sentiments](sahmiye-twitter.html) in text-based data using the holy grail in statistical analysis and deep learning techniques. 

Let's say...like my relatives the sea Crabs, I love digging magical holes just to sniff out fresh data in the sand of time. Call me Joash, or Sahmiye and I will blink my LED sign!
