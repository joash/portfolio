**I am the one!**

It was rusty and clumsy. Baptized the 'Madaraka Express', the smoking train finally snaked its way through a late sunrise into Nairobi. A bunch of lazy hyenas scattered into thickets thick with dew. They laughed; these saliva drenched beasts. Three days of misery riding this 'Express' iron horse out of my village, and four years later studying the art of story telling with a bunch of witty Professors, I knew that my fate was boldy sealed. I would be sitting patiently like an old buffalo, while some silly flies tried to bite my ass. Accidentally, while my village manners were being replaced by city jeans, I won myself the best-student award by hungrily squeezing juice out of Statistics and Computer Science books. Like a mouse trap, I caught those top-grades in hiralious ambushes; late night book-worming!   

While i was being punched with an education, and fried, the good Lord made some beautiful rocks. To humor me, he buried them deep in dirt and allowed mountain gorillas to be sentinels. Look at me now...Lord. I mine these very rocks for something called data; a spice that serious people use today to brew stories of success. I tell stories from data. As for the myth of gorillas, I have never seen 'em. Maybe I am the data gorilla...GRRRRRRR!  

At sunset, it is a bonus if you call me a __data specialist__, an agile software developer or a __visual storyteller__. I go by many names depending on which data mountain I am invading. For the last 10+ years, I have chopped up interesting data on design boards, modelled crazy parts in furnices lit by some bad-ass witchy algorithms, and built solid evidence-based data workflows. When my heavenly star - Cancer, the crab - is out, and running through the seaside, I teach my data models stuff about predictive thinking in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Most times however, I ride a verocious white Cancer branded crab called Sahmiye with a Twitter handle @inNz10 hanging over my ass on the Internet. I sniff, scout, discover and visualize critical insights, hidden patterns, and valuable [sentiments](sahmiye-twitter.html) in text-based data using the magical statistical analysis and deep learning techniques. 

Let's say, like my relatives the sea Crabs, I love digging holes to sniff data in the sand of time. Call me Joash, or Sahmiye!
