A __data specialist__, agile software developer and __visual storyteller__ with 10+ years designing, modeling and building evidence-based data workflows, including predictive algorithms in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). I scout, discover and visualize critical insights, hidden patterns, and valuable sentiments in datasets through statistical analysis and deep learning techniques.
