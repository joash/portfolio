**Press that button...Lights!**

It was rusty and clumsy. Baptized the 'Madaraka Express', the smoking train finally snaked its way through a late sunrise into Nairobi. A bunch of lazy hyenas scattered into thickets thick with dew, laughing. Three days of misery riding this fatigued iron horse out of my village, and four years later studying the art of story telling with a bunch of witty Professors, I knew that my fate was boldy sealed. I would be sitting patiently like a buffalo, while some silly fly tried to bite my ass. Accidentally, I also won myself the best-student award by hungrily squeezing juice out of Statistics and Computer Science books. Most times I caught those top-grades in hiralious ambushes; late night book-worming!   

While i was being educated and fried, the good Lord made some beautiful rocks and buried them deep in dirt and allowed mountain gorillas to be sentinels. I mine these rocks for something called data, a story spice. Today, I tell stories from data. Just ignore the myth of gorillas; I have never seen 'em!  

It is a bonus if you call me a __data specialist__, an agile software developer or a __visual storyteller__. I go by many names depending on which data mountain I am invading. For the last 10+ years, I have chopped up data on design boards, modelled interesting parts in furnices lit by bad-ass algorithms, and built evidence-based data workflows. When heavenly stars are out, and twinkling, I teach my data models heavenly stuff about predictive thinking in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Most times however, I ride a white horse with a Twitter handle over the Internet. I sniff, scout, discover and visualize critical insights, hidden patterns, and valuable [sentiments](sahmiye-twitter.html) in text-based data using the magical statistical analysis and deep learning techniques. 

Let's say, I love chasing rainbows in data!
