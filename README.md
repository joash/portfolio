**Press that button...Lights!**

The rusty coal train finally snaked its way through a late sunrise sending a bunch of lazy hyenas laughing into thickets. Three days of misery riding this iron horse out of my village, and four years later studying the art of story telling with a bunch of witty Professors, I knew my fate was boldy sealed. I accidentally won myself the best-student award by hungrily squeezing juice out of Statistics and Computer Science books, and most times catching those top-grades in hiralious ambushes!   

Today, I tell stories. Hidden in numbers. Better if these numbers have context and they are called data. 

It is a bonus if you call me a __data specialist__, an agile software developer or a __visual storyteller__. For the last 10+ years, I have chopped up stories on design boards, modelled interesting parts in furnices lit by bad ass algorithms, and built evidence-based data workflows. When heavenly stars are out, and twinkling, I teach my data models stuff about predictive thinking in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Most times, I ride a white horse over the Internet scouting, discovering and visualize critical insights, hidden patterns, and valuable [sentiments](sahmiye-twitter.html) in text-based data through statistical analysis and deep learning techniques. 

Let's say, I love the rainbow colors that data paints when i tickle it abit!
