**Press that button...Lights!**

That rusty coal train finally snaked its way through a late sunrise sending a bunch of lazy hyenas laughing into thickets. Three days of misery riding this smoking iron horse out of my village, and four years later studying the art of story telling with a bunch of witty Professors, I knew that my fate was boldy sealed. Accidentally, I won myself the best-student award by hungrily squeezing juice out of Statistics and Computer Science books, and most times catching those top-grades in hiralious ambushes!   

Today, I tell stories; mined from rocks with numbers. Some rocks are buried in mountains with context and gorillas, and they are called data. 

It is a bonus if you call me a __data specialist__, an agile software developer or a __visual storyteller__. I go by many names depending on which data store I am invading. For the last 10+ years, I have chopped up data on design boards, modelled interesting parts in furnices lit by bad-ass algorithms, and built evidence-based data workflows. When heavenly stars are out, and twinkling, I teach my data models stuff about predictive thinking in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Most times however, I ride a white horse with a Twitter handle over the Internet scouting, discovering and visualizing critical insights, hidden patterns, and valuable [sentiments](sahmiye-twitter.html) in text-based data through statistical analysis and deep learning techniques. 

Let's say, I love chasing rainbows!
